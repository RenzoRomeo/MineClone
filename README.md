# MineClone

This is a Minecraft clone that I made using OpenGL.

I always loved this game, and recently I became very interested in computer graphics and game development, so I figured the best way to learn how to make a game is to make one!

# Dependencies
- OpenGL (Graphics API)
- GLFW (Window handling / OpenGL context)
- GLAD (OpenGL Bindings)
- GLM (Maths)
- stb_image (Loading images)

# TODO

- Chunk culling.
- Jumping / falling.
- Placing / removing blocks.
- Better way to add cubes. Something like yaml.
- GUI.
- Multithreading for creating chunk meshes and other stuff.
