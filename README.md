# MineClone

This is not the first Minecraft clone that I made, but it is the best one I made so far.

It is my first "big" project regarding computer graphics, so I learned a lot while working on it.

# TODO

- Chunk culling.
- Jumping / falling.
- Placing / removing blocks.
- Terrain generation with Perlin noise.
- Better way to add cubes.
- GUI.
